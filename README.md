### A fun game to pass the time.
********************************************************************************
SlapJack is a card game played between two players locally using one keyboard.


### But why?
********************************************************************************
For fun!


###  How does it work?
********************************************************************************
It works just like the game in the real world except it uses a keyboard and has some cool
features.

Player one will have the left side of the board and use the q key to play a card from their pile
and the f key to slap the cards. Player two will use the p key to play a card and the j key to slap
a card.

The winner is the first person to slap a valid card when the other player is out of cards. Valid cards are
Jacks, doubles and sandwiches. Jacks are just the card Jack. Doubles are when two cards are played back to back
with the same value. A sandwich is when there are two cards played of the same value but are separated by a different card. Slapping any of these valid plays results in the slapping player taking the entire center pile, shuffling with their own deck and continuing to play. If a player slaps during anything other than these valid plays they will forfeit their top card to be placed at the bottom of their opponents deck.

To win the game the player who has not ran out of cards must keep playing their cards until a Jack appears and they must slap it before the player who has run out of cards does. If they dont the other player takes the stack and is back in the game. If the player without cards slaps anything other than a Jack they will lose.

### How did I do this?
********************************************************************************
This was a completely solo project that I was able to build using the technology below.


### Technologies we used
********************************************************************************
- JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS
- GithubProjects


### Goals and Objectives
********************************************************************************
- To have fully functioning SlapJack game that strictly adhered to the rules of the game.
- Write clean readable code utilizing SRP and DRY principles when and where possible.
- Utilize classes that never affected the DOM and always updated the data model directly
- Better understand how to use `localStorage` and how to use in a way to constantly update data


### Future Iterations
********************************************************************************
- I think it could be good to add a counter to each players deck to understand how far they are from being out.
- Maybe have a handful or dynamic images that change as the deck moves along.
